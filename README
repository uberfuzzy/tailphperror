    a simple web interface to simulate doing `tail php_error.log`

I wrote this to easily access the php error log without having to ssh into the server and tail the log when a page was showing up "broken".
This also removed my need to turn on public error messages while live testing.

It has a few crude query params to add some of the tail features.
Like "n=50" to show 50 lines then the default 20, and "auto=15" to auto reload the page every 15 seconds.
(docs needed)

It "works" on both windows and linux, making some best attempts to adapt as needed. This did add some complexity over time, but meh.

It does some filtering to add some colors to error type (warnings in yellow, parse in red, etc) and to shorten (and lazy hide) some disk paths.
The 2 main string replacements were for the rootpart to my home dir to "~", and my dropbox path to "$DROPBOX".
There is support for defining an array of server specific replacements, but this is very hacky (again, this is personal code)
There is a query param to disable this HTML markup, somewhere.

Note: This is in no way meant to be secure, I dont filter everything (It was made for my system paths), and is entirely at your own risk.
That said, to be fair its not any more "insecure" then turning on error messages to the public.
You might leak some disk paths/folder names, and that might be more a privacy concern more then a security issue.

I might add support for hiding behind a BASIC auth prompt.
I might also add IP restriction logic.
